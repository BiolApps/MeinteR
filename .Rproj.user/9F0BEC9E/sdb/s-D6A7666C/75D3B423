The objective is to map genomic sites and their methylation states to functional information related with various types of regulatory elements involved in gene expression. The input data are simple tabular files in bed format. These files can be exported using various methylation analysis packages eg. RnBeads, ChAMP, DMRcate etc. All types of single-base resolution assays are supported including Illumina's 450k, EPIC methylation arrays , whole-genome, reduced representation and targeted bisulfite-sequencing.\n\\subsection{Installation}\nMeinteR is available either through automatic or manual installation. To download MeinteR and it's dependencies automatically \nsimply execute the following R command:\n\n@\n```{r,results=\"hide\"}\n# install through bioconductor\n#source(\"http://www.bioconductor.org/meinter\")\n# or installation using local distribution of the package\n#install.packages(\"<local_path>/MeinteR_1.0.tgz\")\n```\n\nUpon successful installation load Meinter and all its dependencies:\n```{r, echo=\"false\", results=\"hide\"}\nlibrary(MeinteR)\n```\n\\subsection{Data}\nMeinteR inputs are 4-colum bed files containing chromosome, start position, end position of each methylation site and the difference of the methylation levels between two groups e.g. normal/disease samples or pre-,post-treatment conditions of the same sample.\nTo work on a sample dataset use:\n\n```{r}\ndata(sample)\nhead(sample)\n```\nIn each function data are split into two groups by a grouping threshold (group.thr). One group contains the methylation sites for which the absolute delta values are higher than the grouping threshold and the second group contains the remaisning sites with absolute delta methylation values lesser than group.thr.\n\n\\subsection{MeinteR Functions}\n\\subsubsection{Alternative splicing events (findAltSpliceDMSOverlaps)}\nThis function maps the methylation sites of each group to alternative splicing events (UCSC Alt events track) and reports in tabular and graphical representations the co-localized alternative splicing events, their type and the statistical significance using chi-square tests. The following, is an example usage of this function on the sample dataset.\n\n```{r}\nalt.splice <- findAltSpliceDMSOverlaps(bed.data = sample, group.name = \"Sample\", group.thr = 0.4)\n```\nThis command will a) fetch the Alt events track from UCSC (needs internet connection), b) split sample data into two groups using 0.4 as methylation difference as grouping threshold, and c) match each methylation site to any of the 94,820 alternative splicing events (Data last updated: 2013-06-14). The output is a 5-element list\n\n",
