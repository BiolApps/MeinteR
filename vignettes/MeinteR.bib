  doi = {10.1186/s13072-018-0174-4},
  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} DNA shape analysis has demonstrated the potential to reveal structure-based mechanisms of pro-tein\textendash{}DNA binding. However, information about the influence of chemical modification of DNA is limited. Cytosine methylation, the most frequent modification, represents the addition of a methyl group at the major groove edge of the cytosine base. In mammalian genomes, cytosine methylation most frequently occurs at CpG dinucleotides. In addition to changing the chemical signature of C/G base pairs, cytosine methylation can affect DNA structure. Since the original discovery of DNA methylation, major efforts have been made to understand its effect from a sequence perspective. Compared to unmethylated DNA, however, little structural information is available for methylated DNA, due to the limited number of experimentally determined structures. To achieve a better mechanistic understanding of the effect of CpG methylation on local DNA structure, we developed a high-throughput method, methyl-DNAshape, for predicting the effect of cytosine methylation on DNA shape.
Results:\hspace{0.6em} Using our new method, we found that CpG methylation significantly altered local DNA shape. Four DNA shape features\textemdash{}helix twist, minor groove width, propeller twist, and roll\textemdash{}were considered in this analysis. Distinct distributions of effect size were observed for different features. Roll and propeller twist were the DNA shape features most strongly affected by CpG methylation with an effect size depending on the local sequence context. Methyla-tion-induced changes in DNA shape were predictive of the measured rate of cleavage by DNase I and suggest a pos-sible mechanism for some of the methylation sensitivities that were recently observed for human Pbx-Hox complexes.
Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} CpG methylation is an important epigenetic mark in the mammalian genome. Understanding its role in protein\textendash{}DNA recognition can further our knowledge of gene regulation. Our high-throughput methyl-DNAshape method can be used to predict the effect of cytosine methylation on DNA shape and its subsequent influence on protein\textendash{}DNA interactions. This approach overcomes the limited availability of experimental DNA structures that con-tain 5-methylcytosine.},

  abstract = {Sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling methods are comprehensive and, as accuracy and affordability improve, will increasingly supplant microarrays for genome-scale analyses. Here, four sequencing-based methodologies were applied to biological replicates of human embryonic stem cells to compare their CpG coverage genome-wide and in transposons, resolution, cost, concordance and its relationship with CpG density and genomic context. The two bisulfite methods reached concordance of 82\% for CpG methylation levels and 99\% for non-CpG cytosine methylation levels. Using binary methylation calls, two enrichment methods were 99\% concordant, while regions assessed by all four methods were 97\% concordant. To achieve comprehensive methylome coverage while reducing cost, an approach integrating two complementary methods was examined. The integrative methylome profile along with histone methylation, RNA, and SNP profiles derived from the sequence reads allowed genome-wide assessment of allele-specific epigenetic states, identifying most known imprinted regions and new loci with monoallelic epigenetic marks and monoallelic expression.},

  abstract = {Background: Aberrant DNA methylation profiles are a characteristic of all known cancer types, epitomized by the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Hypermethylation has been observed at CpG islands throughout the genome, but it is unclear which factors determine whether an individual island becomes methylated in cancer.
Methods: DNA methylation in CRC was analysed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array. Differentially methylated loci were identified using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank (WSR) test. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to identify methylation subtypes in CRC.
Results: In this study we characterized the DNA methylation profiles of 94 CRC tissues and their matched normal counterparts. Consistent with previous studies, unsupervized hierarchical clustering of genome-wide methylation data identified three subtypes within the tumour samples, designated CIMP-H, CIMP-L and CIMP-N, that showed high, low and very low methylation levels, respectively. Differential methylation between normal and tumour samples was analysed at the individual CpG level, and at the gene level. The distribution of hypermethylation in CIMP-N tumours showed high inter-tumour variability and appeared to be highly stochastic in nature, whereas CIMP-H tumours exhibited consistent hypermethylation at a subset of genes, in addition to a highly variable background of hypermethylated genes. EYA4, TFPI2 and TLX1 were hypermethylated in more than 90\% of all tumours examined. One-hundred thirty-two genes were hypermethylated in 100\% of CIMP-H tumours studied and these were highly enriched for functions relating to skeletal system development (Bonferroni adjusted p value =2. 88E-15), segment specification (adjusted p value =9.62E-11), embryonic development (adjusted p value =1.52E-04), mesoderm development (adjusted p value =1.14E-20), and ectoderm development (adjusted p value =7.94E-16).
Conclusions: Our genome-wide characterization of DNA methylation in colorectal cancer has identified 132 genes hypermethylated in 100\% of CIMP-H samples. Three genes, EYA4, TLX1 and TFPI2 are hypermethylated in $>$90\% of all tumour samples, regardless of CIMP subtype.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is essential in brain function and behavior; therefore, understanding the role of DNA methylation in brain-based disorders begins with the study of DNA methylation profiles in normal brain. Determining the patterns and scale of methylation conservation and alteration in an evolutionary context enables the design of focused but effective methylation studies of disease states. We applied an enzymatic-based approach, Methylation Mapping Analysis by Paired-end Sequencing (Methyl-MAPS), which utilizes second-generation sequencing technology to provide an unbiased representation of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human and mouse brains. In this large-scale study, we assayed CpG methylation in cerebral cortex of neurologically and psychiatrically normal human postmortem specimens, as well as mouse forebrain specimens. Cross-species human-mouse DNA methylation conservation analysis shows that DNA methylation is not correlated with sequence conservation. Instead, greater DNA methylation conservation is correlated with increasing CpG density. In addition to CpG density, these data show that genomic context is a critical factor in DNA methylation conservation and alteration signatures throughout mammalian brain evolution. We identify key genomic features that can be targeted for identification of epigenetic loci that may be developmentally and evolutionarily conserved and wherein aberrations in DNA methylation patterns can confer risk for disease.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and essential for normal development,. Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos\textendash, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns with 70\textendash{}80\% of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances we still have a too limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in depth analysis of 42 whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8\% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, a majority of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), which allow identification of key lineage specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often harbor SNPs associated with cell type related diseases as determined by GWAS. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of WGBS as 70\textendash{}80\% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information regarding CpG methylation. To further demonstrate the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to help guide novel, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.},

  abstract = {In vertebrates, methylation of cytosine at CpG sequences is implicated in stable and heritable patterns of gene expression. The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly hypermethylated, while larger clusters are predominantly hypo-methylated. Intermediate clusters, however, are either hyper- or hypo-methylated but are rarely found in intermediate methylation states. We develop a model for spatially-dependent collaboration between CpGs, where methylated CpGs recruit methylation enzymes that can act on CpGs over an extended local region, while unmethylated CpGs recruit demethylation enzymes that act more strongly on nearby CpGs. This model can reproduce the effects of CpG clustering on methylation and produces stable and heritable alternative methylation states of CpG clusters, thus providing a coherent model for methylation inheritance and methylation patterning.},

These factors can contribute to a consistent allelic dropout (ADO) of the maternally methylated DNA during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of such gene regions. Here, we directly investigate the cause of allelic dropout by applying fluorescent techniques to visualize polymerase amplification and arrest during PCR of differentially methylated DNA templates. We demonstrate that polymerase arrest corresponds to previously characterized G-quadruplex-forming motifs at the MEST promoter region and occurs at equivalent sites on both methylated and nonmethylated DNA templates. However, during PCR, polymerase arrest can be observed on the methylated template for several cycles longer than on the nonmethylated template, and this results in an amplification lag and a lower yield of full length amplicons. We demonstrate that this delay in amplification is sufficient to cause complete ADO during PCR, providing a mechanistic basis for the previously observed genotyping error at this locus.},
