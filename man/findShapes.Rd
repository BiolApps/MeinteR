\title{Find putative conformational DNA changes}
\usage{
findShapes(bed.data, offset = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{bed.data}{A data frame containing input bed-formatted data}

\item{offset}{Number of nucleotides expanded in each direction (default:50, max:200)}
}
\value{
1/ p-value of the MGW in the unmethylated/methylated CpG context for each sequence

2/ p-value of the HeIT in the unmethylated/methylated CpG context for each sequence

3/ p-value of the ProT in the unmethylated/methylated CpG context for each sequence

4/ p-value of the Roll in the unmethylated/methylated CpG context for each sequence
}
\description{
Predicts conformational changes of DNA shapes, such as
minor groove width (MGW), Roll, propeller twist (ProT) and helix twist (HeIT)
in the unmethylated and methylated context using methyl-DNAshape algorithm.
